Trending Section:
Slider for weights
Establish Thresholds for Significance, as a setting
Daily views needs to be taken from the last day for calculations
Need to introduce a new table for the db that holds all the virality metrics.

I need to introduce the concept of products, so that videos can be assigned to them and benchkmark metrics creation. Likely need new DB. Be able to introduce multiple product titles per product. Needs to callout when a video has been logged and no product title matched.


Need to use the current data to try and determine which metrics have the highest correlation to trending, and assign weights to each metric.
Starting to Trend:
- Identify videos that are starting to trend. It should identify when a given video is starting to have a significant improvement in performance for any of the above key metrics. It should then display these outperforming videos in a separate table like UI.
- We need a setting to put a Video View threshold for what is considered starting to trend. If a video is growing 100% but it's just 10 video views, that's not effective.
- Need to be able to select videos for close tracking.

Trending Section Descrtion:
The Trending Section should display videos that are trending for a given day according to the following key metrics, Views, Shares, Comments, GMV, CTR, CTOR, Video Finish Rate.
This section should allow you to input a date (by default is the latest date for which data has been inputted) and then show the performance of videos in a table like format but only showing the above metrics as well as the video ID.

The Trending section should also have features that allow the following:

- Calculate benchmark data for the key metrics above at a product level. Based on all the video data ingested, it should calculate benchmark values for each product and then identify videos that are outperforming the benchmkark. It should then display these outperforming videos in a separate table like UI.

The Trending section should in total have three window views. One for the top videos of the selected date, one for the videos overperfoming benchmark, and one for the identified videos that are starting to trend.

- Add a function that detects when videos are growing in views and send a notification to the user.
- Add a function that helps product performance and then show videos that are ourperforming for that product.
- I want the UI to be adaptive of my PC resolution?
- Add a Help menu with a link to the readme.
    Include a glossary of metrics.
    Include a description of every dashboard?

Improvements:
- Add a log. Need to have a log of certain events like adding data, deleting data, etc.
-Dynamic Metric Handling: Consider allowing multiple metrics to be plotted simultaneously, not just two.
-Interactive Plots: Explore adding interactive features like zooming or hovering to see data values using libraries like mplcursors (already used in your code).
-Data Normalization: When plotting metrics with vastly different scales, consider normalizing or scaling the data to make the plot more informative.


To Test:
    Monthly aggregation plotting.
    There's a warning when plotting dual metrics.
        UserWarning: Selection.target.index is deprecated and will be removed in the future; use Selection.index instead.
When clearing performance, the Last Performance Data is not being updated.

Refactoring:
- Does it make sense to ingest data as strings and then convert to floats?
- There's a warning when ingesting excel files.
- Consolidate library imports.

Ancilliary

- Add docstrings to all the functions.
- Adopt code organization practices (organized methods?)
- When I click on a section, like the video details section, that section expands so I an have a better view. Make this a setting.
- Set threshold for video ingesting. Make this a setting.
- Database cleanup. When an ingested video has had less than 4000 views for more than X time, stop ingesting video.
- DB backup cleanup. Clear old backups.
- Improve the date selection process for the database clearing function.
- Add functionality for week long data, like deleting data for a full week.
- Add comments to the code to explain what is happening.
- Allow me to increase or decrease the area of Video Database Records section, Video Details or Plotting section.
- Generate Docstrings for all the functions and methods.
- Color coding. Video IDs need colocr coding when they reach a certain threshold like 50k views. Make this an adjustable setting.
- Add progress bar for upload_file function when dealing with multi files.
- For processing single file, add a Yes to All option for replacing data when it already exists.
- Implemment messagebox threading so the process doesn't freeze when uploading a file.
    Implement for the process_single_file function.
- Review database backup calls/generations. There may be too many.
- Create a QA list for the app.
- Create testing for the app. Some code that is able to test output versus what's in the database, or what's in the input files.
