- Add better plotting capabilities, like agregating data per week and plot multiple variables.
++ Continue debugging the aggregation.
- Add a function that detects when videos are growing in views and send a notification to the user.
- I want the UI to be adaptive of my PC resolution?
- Add a Help menu with a link to the readme.
    Include a glossary of metrics.
    Include a description of every dashboard?

Improvements:
- Excel file processor:
    Automatically detect the date based on the file data.
-Dynamic Metric Handling: Consider allowing multiple metrics to be plotted simultaneously, not just two.
-Interactive Plots: Explore adding interactive features like zooming or hovering to see data values using libraries like mplcursors (already used in your code).
-Data Normalization: When plotting metrics with vastly different scales, consider normalizing or scaling the data to make the plot more informative.

Bugs:
Plotting:
    Weekly aggregation of % based metrics doesn't work when there's more than one data point for the week.
Data:
    New ingestion transforms % based metrics to float. Need to transform them back to % for plotting.
To Test:
    Monthly aggregation plotting.
    See if week start is influencing plotting.

Refactoring:
- Does it make sense to ingest data as strings and then convert to floats?
- Consolidate library imports.

Ancilliary

- When I click on a section, like the video details section, that section expands so I an have a better view. Make this a setting.
- Set threshold for video ingesting. Make this a setting.
- Database cleanup. When an ingested video has had less than 4000 views for more than X time, stop ingesting video.
- DB backup cleanup. Clear old backups.
- Improve the date selection process for the database clearing function.
- Add functionality for week long data, like deleting data for a full week.
- Add comments to the code to explain what is happening.
- Allow me to increase or decrease the area of Video Database Records section, Video Details or Plotting section.
- Generate Docstrings for all the functions and methods.
- Color coding. Video IDs need colocr coding when they reach a certain threshold like 50k views. Make this an adjustable setting.
- Add progress bar for upload_file function when dealing with multi files.
- For processing single file, add a Yes to All option for replacing data when it already exists.
- Implemment messagebox threading so the process doesn't freeze when uploading a file.
    Implement for the process_single_file function.
- Review database backup calls/generations. There may be too many.
