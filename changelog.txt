[2024-09-25] Improved Sorting Functionality and Revenue Display

- Enhanced the `treeview_sort_column` method in the `TikTokTrackerGUI` class to properly handle both numeric and string values for sorting.
- Updated the column creation in the `create_widgets` method to ensure proper sorting is applied when column headers are clicked.
- Modified the `get_all_videos` method in the `DataManager` class to round the total video revenue to two decimal places.
- Updated the `search_videos` method in the `DataManager` class to also round the total video revenue to two decimal places for consistency.
- These changes improve the sorting functionality in the Video Database Records section and ensure that video revenue is consistently displayed with a maximum of two decimal places.

[2024-09-24] Changed methods's names to be more descriptive.

[2024-09-24] Aggregated Video Data in Video Database Records and Video Details

- Modified the `get_all_videos` method in the `DataManager` class to return aggregated data for each video ID.
- Updated the `load_all_videos` method in the `TikTokTrackerGUI` class to display the aggregated data in the Video Database Records section.

[2024-09-24] Added Persistence for VV Threshold Setting

- Added methods to save and load the VV threshold to/from a JSON file in the DataManager class.
- Modified the DataManager class to load the VV threshold from the JSON file on initialization.
- Updated the SettingsWindow class to save the new threshold using the set_vv_threshold method.

[2024-09-23] Added Settings Menu and Configurable VV Threshold

- Added a Settings menu to the main GUI.
- Created a new SettingsWindow class for configuring application settings.
- Implemented the ability to modify the Video View Ingestion threshold through the Settings window.
- Modified the DataManager class to use a configurable VV threshold instead of a hardcoded value.
- Updated the filter_videos method in DataManager to use the new configurable threshold.

[2024-09-22] Plotting Functionality Improvements and Bug Fixes

- Renamed the `plot_metric` method in `gui.py` to `create_metric_plot` for clarity and to distinguish it from the `plot_metric` method in `plotter.py`.
- Updated references to the renamed method in `gui.py`, including the plot button creation and the `plot_metric_from_context` method.
- Modified the `Plotter` class in `plotter.py` to fix initialization issues with figure and axes:
  - Added `self.ax` attribute initialization in the `__init__` method.
  - Updated `clear_plot` method to also clear the `ax` attribute.
  - Modified `plot_metric` method to create new figure and axes if they don't exist.
- These changes resolve the AttributeError related to the 'ax' attribute and ensure the plotter section appears correctly in the interface.
- Improved overall stability and consistency of the plotting functionality.

[2024-09-20] Video Ingestion Logic Update
- Modified the video ingestion logic to continue tracking videos that have ever reached 4000 VV.
- Updated the `filter_videos` method in the `DataManager` class to include videos already in the database, regardless of their current VV count.
- Added a new `get_existing_video_ids` method to fetch all video IDs from the database.
- Updated the `insert_or_update_records` method to ensure it updates existing records and adds new ones as needed.
- This change ensures that once a video is ingested (reaches 4000 VV), it continues to be tracked in subsequent uploads, even if its VV drops below 4000.
