Bug Fixes for Plotting X-axis Issues

- Resolved issues where:
  - Single data point plots displayed an X-axis spanning multiple months.
    - Updated `plot_metric` in `Plotter` class to set X-axis limits narrowly around the single date.
  - X-axis showed duplicate dates with no data points.
    - Customized X-axis ticks to display only dates from the data, eliminating duplicates.
  - Improved date label formatting and rotation for better readability.

These changes ensure that plots accurately represent the data with correct X-axis labeling.

[2024-09-26] Plotting Functionality Improvements and Bug Fixes

  - Implemented conversion of percentage strings to floats for percentage-based metrics.
  - Updated y-axis formatting for percentage-based metrics to display values as percentages.
  - Improved error handling and logging for better debugging.

- Updated the `create_selected_video_metric_plot` method in the `TikTokTrackerGUI` class:
  - Added debug logging to track data retrieval and processing.
  - Implemented checks to ensure data is available before attempting to plot.

- Resolved issues with plotting various metrics:
  - Fixed the y-axis display for percentage-based metrics (CTR, CTOR, Video Finish Rate, V-to-L rate).

  - New Followers
  - V-to-L clicks
  - Buyers
  - GPM

- Updated the `create_selected_video_metric_plot` and `plot_metric_from_context` methods in the `TikTokTrackerGUI` class to handle the conversion between display metric names and database column names consistently.
- These changes ensure that only the desired metrics can be plotted and improve the overall consistency of the plotting functionality across different parts of the application.

[2024-09-25] Added Safeguard for Single-Day Data and Renamed Excel Reading Method

- Renamed `read_excel` method to `read_video_performance_excel` in the `DataManager` class for improved clarity.
- Modified `extract_date_from_range` method to raise an error if the date range in the Excel file spans multiple days.
- Updated `upload_file` method in `TikTokTrackerGUI` class to handle the new error and display appropriate messages to the user.
- These changes ensure that only single-day data can be processed, preventing potential data inconsistencies from multi-day uploads.

- Updated the `search_videos` method in the `DataManager` class to also round the total video revenue to two decimal places for consistency.
- These changes improve the sorting functionality in the Video Database Records section and ensure that video revenue is consistently displayed with a maximum of two decimal places.

[2024-09-24] Changed methods's names to be more descriptive.

[2024-09-24] Aggregated Video Data in Video Database Records and Video Details

- Modified the `get_all_videos` method in the `DataManager` class to return aggregated data for each video ID.
- Updated the `load_all_videos` method in the `TikTokTrackerGUI` class to display the aggregated data in the Video Database Records section.

- Added methods to save and load the VV threshold to/from a JSON file in the DataManager class.
- Modified the DataManager class to load the VV threshold from the JSON file on initialization.
- Updated the SettingsWindow class to save the new threshold using the set_vv_threshold method.

[2024-09-23] Added Settings Menu and Configurable VV Threshold

- Added a Settings menu to the main GUI.
- Created a new SettingsWindow class for configuring application settings.
- Implemented the ability to modify the Video View Ingestion threshold through the Settings window.

- Modified the video ingestion logic to continue tracking videos that have ever reached 4000 VV.
- Updated the `filter_videos` method in the `DataManager` class to include videos already in the database, regardless of their current VV count.
- Added a new `get_existing_video_ids` method to fetch all video IDs from the database.
- Updated the `insert_or_update_records` method to ensure it updates existing records and adds new ones as needed.
- This change ensures that once a video is ingested (reaches 4000 VV), it continues to be tracked in subsequent uploads, even if its VV drops below 4000.
